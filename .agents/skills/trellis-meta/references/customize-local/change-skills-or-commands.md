# Change Local Skills, Commands, Prompts, And Workflows

When the user wants to change AI entry points, auto-trigger rules, or explicit command behavior, edit skills, commands, prompts, or workflows in local platform directories.

Before editing, classify the skill you are about to touch:

- **Bundled skill (maintained in the trellis-kerminal CLI repo)** — `trellis-meta`, `trellis-spec-bootstrap`, `trellis-session-insight`. Source of truth lives in the trellis-kerminal CLI repo under `packages/cli/src/templates/common/bundled-skills/<name>/`; auto-dispatched to the shared `.agents/skills/` root by `getBundledSkillTemplates()` on `trellis init` / `trellis update`. Local edits here are tracked by `.trellis/.template-hashes.json` and will be flagged on the next update.
- **Project-local skill** — anything else under `.agents/skills/` or `.kerminal/skills/`. Owned by the user; not refreshed by `trellis update`.

The remainder of this file uses "skill" for the local file; the override and conflict rules differ between the two cases.

## Read These Files First

1. `.trellis/workflow.md`
2. Target platform skill/command/prompt/workflow directory
3. Related agent or hook files
4. Whether project rules already exist in `.trellis/spec/`
5. `.trellis/.template-hashes.json` — confirms whether the skill you are about to edit is a bundled skill maintained in the trellis-kerminal CLI repo (entry present) or project-local (entry absent)

## Which Entry Type To Choose

| Goal | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| AI should automatically know a capability | Add or modify a skill. |
| User wants to trigger manually with a command | Add or modify a command/prompt/workflow. |
| Team project conventions | Prefer `.trellis/spec/` or a project-local skill — never a bundled skill directory. |
| Tweak a bundled skill (`trellis-meta` et al.) for the user's own project | Create a project-local sibling skill (different name) that overrides intent, or edit `.trellis/spec/`. Edits inside the bundled skill directory survive only until the next `trellis update` and will need a "keep" choice each time. |
| Contribute the change to the trellis-kerminal CLI repo | Edit `packages/cli/src/templates/common/bundled-skills/<name>/` in the trellis-kerminal CLI repo, not the deployed copy. |
| Change Trellis flow semantics | Synchronize `.trellis/workflow.md`. |

## Modify A Skill

A skill is usually:

```text
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
```

`SKILL.md` should be short and responsible for triggering/routing. Put long content in `references/` so AI can read it on demand.

The frontmatter description should specify when to use the skill. Example:

```yaml
description: "Use when customizing this project's deployment workflow and release checklist."
```

Do not write vague descriptions such as "helpful project skill"; they can trigger incorrectly.

### Bundled vs. Project-Local

The same directory shape is used by two very different ownership models:

| Aspect | Bundled (`trellis-meta`, `trellis-spec-bootstrap`, `trellis-session-insight`) | Project-local |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source of truth | `packages/cli/src/templates/common/bundled-skills/<name>/` in the trellis-kerminal CLI repo | Inside the user project itself |
| Dispatch | Auto-dispatched to the shared `.agents/skills/` root by `getBundledSkillTemplates()` (`packages/cli/src/templates/common/index.ts`) on `trellis init` / `trellis update` | Created by the user (or another skill) and never moved |
| Hash tracking | Every file recorded in `.trellis/.template-hashes.json`; conflict prompt on update | Not tracked |
| Editing locally | Allowed but will be marked "modified by user" on next update | Free editing |
| The right way to customize | Add a *new* project-local skill with a *different* name that supplements (or supersedes) the bundled one | Edit the file directly |

If the goal is "make my project's AI behave differently when discussing release notes," the answer is almost always a project-local skill, not surgery on `trellis-meta/`.

## Modify A Command/Prompt/Workflow

Explicit entry points should state:

- How the user triggers it.
- Which `.trellis/` files to read.
- Which scripts to run.
- How to report after completion.

If a command only repeats workflow rules, prefer making it reference/read `.trellis/workflow.md` instead of maintaining a second copy of the flow.

## Common Paths

| Platform | Skill/command directories |
| --- | --- |
| Kerminal | `.kerminal/skills/` (entry skills), `.agents/skills/` (shared skills) |

Both directories above are deploy targets: `trellis init` writes them and `trellis update` refreshes them; nothing has to be wired by hand.

## Add A Project-Local Skill

If the user wants to document team-private customizations, create a project-local skill — never put project-private content into a bundled skill directory, since `trellis update` will overwrite it.

```text
.agents/skills/project-trellis-local/
└── SKILL.md
```

Pick a name that does **not** collide with the bundled set:

- `trellis-meta`
- `trellis-spec-bootstrap`
- `trellis-session-insight`

A reused name causes `getBundledSkillTemplates()` to overwrite the project-local copy on the next update. A common convention is to prefix the project name: `acme-trellis-deploy`, `acme-trellis-onboarding`.

## Notes

- Do not change only one entry point (e.g., an entry skill) while `.trellis/workflow.md` still describes the old behavior.
- Do not hide long-term engineering conventions inside a command; write them to `.trellis/spec/`.
- Do not hand-edit files inside `trellis-meta/`, `trellis-spec-bootstrap/`, or `trellis-session-insight/` under `.agents/skills/` expecting the change to persist — they are bundled and refreshed by `trellis update`. Either contribute to the trellis-kerminal CLI repo or add a project-local skill that complements them.
- After `trellis update` reports a "modified by you" conflict on a bundled skill file, choose **keep** only if you accept maintaining the divergence by hand; otherwise accept the overwrite and re-apply the intent as a project-local skill.
