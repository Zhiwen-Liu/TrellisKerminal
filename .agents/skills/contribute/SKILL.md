# Contributing to TrellisKerminal

TrellisKerminal is an engineering framework for
[Kerminal](https://kerminal.cn/). Everything lives in **this one repo** —
docs are plain Markdown under `docs/`.

| What | Where in this repo |
|------|-------------------|
| User documentation | `docs/` (plain Markdown) |
| Readme / marketing | `README.md` + `README_CN.md` (root) |
| Workflow skills (`trellis-brainstorm`, `trellis-before-dev`, `trellis-check`, `trellis-break-loop`, `trellis-update-spec`) | `packages/cli/src/templates/common/skills/` |
| Bundled skills (`trellis-meta`, `trellis-spec-bootstrap`, `trellis-session-insight`) | `packages/cli/src/templates/common/bundled-skills/` |
| Entry command skills (`trellis-start`, `trellis-continue`, `trellis-finish-work`) | `packages/cli/src/templates/common/commands/` |
| Kerminal platform files (`.kerminal/` content, incl. agent prompts) | `packages/cli/src/templates/kerminal/` |
| Shared `.trellis/` runtime (scripts, `workflow.md`, agents, task templates) | `packages/cli/src/templates/trellis/` |
| Spec markdown templates (seeded by `trellis init`) | `packages/cli/src/templates/markdown/spec/` |

## Golden Rule: Templates First

The copies at the repo root — `.kerminal/`, `.agents/skills/trellis-*`,
`.trellis/workflow.md`, `.trellis/scripts/` — are **generated dogfood output**,
not sources of truth.

1. Change the template under `packages/cli/src/templates/`.
2. Rebuild: `pnpm build` (runs `copy-templates` into `dist/`).
3. Run tests: `pnpm test` (template suites live in `packages/cli/test/templates/`).
4. Refresh this repo's own install: `trellis update`.

Editing the generated copies directly means the next `trellis update`
overwrites your work.

## Contributing Documentation

- Pages live in `docs/` as plain Markdown — edit them directly.
- `README.md` and `README_CN.md` must stay in sync: any change to one
  language needs the same change in the other.
- Keep the project positioning accurate: TrellisKerminal is a standalone
  project for Kerminal, published as the single npm package
  `trellis-kerminal`. Issues and PRs all happen in this repo.

## Contributing a Skill or Workflow Change

1. Locate the template directory (table above).
2. Follow the existing skill format: `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
   (`name`, `description`), optional `references/` for detail docs.
3. Platform-tagged content: `workflow.md` and step details are filtered by
   `--platform kerminal`; when adding platform blocks, tag them
   `[Kerminal]` / `[/Kerminal]`.
4. Rebuild + test (`pnpm build && pnpm test`), then refresh the dogfood
   install (`trellis update`) and inspect the generated diff.

## Contributing a Spec Template

Spec seeds for *user projects* live in
`packages/cli/src/templates/markdown/spec/`. This repo's own specs live in
`.trellis/spec/` and are project-local knowledge, not shipped templates —
update them via the `trellis-update-spec` workflow rather than editing
indexes by hand.

## Development Setup

```bash
pnpm install        # workspace deps
pnpm build          # tsc + copy-templates
pnpm test           # vitest (unit + integration + template tests)
pnpm lint           # ESLint
pnpm -C packages/cli lint:py   # basedpyright for Python templates/scripts
```

## Submitting a PR

1. Fork [Zhiwen-Liu/TrellisKerminal](https://github.com/Zhiwen-Liu/TrellisKerminal) and clone your fork.
2. Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/your-change`.
3. Make the change in `packages/cli/src/templates/` (or `docs/`, `README*`).
4. Run checks: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`.
5. Commit with a conventional message, e.g. `docs(readme): ...`,
   `feat(kerminal): ...`, `fix(cli): ...`.
6. Push and open a PR against `main`.
